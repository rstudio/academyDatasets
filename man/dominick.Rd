\description{
From the \href{https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/dominicks}{Chicago Booth Kilts Center for Marketing}:

From 1989 to 1994, Chicago Booth and Dominickâ€™s Finer Foods entered into a
partnership for store-level research into shelf management and pricing.
Randomized experiments were conducted in more than 25 different categories
throughout all stores in this 100-store chain. As a by-product of this
research cooperation, approximately nine years of store-level data on the
sales of more than 3,500 UPCs is available in this dataset. This data is
unique for the breadth of its coverage and for the information available on
retail margins.

The customer count file includes information about in-store traffic. The data
is store specific and on a daily basis. The customer count data refers to the
number of customers visiting the store and purchasing something. Also in the
customer count file is a total dollar sales and total coupons redeemed
figure, by DFF defined department. These figures are compiled daily from the
register/scanner receipts.
