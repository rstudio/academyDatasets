\description{
From the \href{https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/dominicks}{Chicago Booth Kilts Center for Marketing}:

From 1989 to 1994, Chicago Booth and Dominickâ€™s Finer Foods entered into a
partnership for store-level research into shelf management and pricing.
Randomized experiments were conducted in more than 25 different categories
throughout all stores in this 100-store chain. As a by-product of this
research cooperation, approximately nine years of store-level data on the
sales of more than 3,500 UPCs is available in this dataset. This data is
unique for the breadth of its coverage and for the information available on
retail margins.

The data contain a description of each UPC in a category and sales
information at the store level for each UPC in a category. The information is
stored on a weekly basis.

Note: This is historical data and the products are not for sale.
