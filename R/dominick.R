#'
#' From 1989 to 1994, Chicago Booth and Dominick’s Finer Foods entered into a
#' partnership for store-level research into shelf management and pricing.
#' Randomized experiments were conducted in more than 25 different categories
#' throughout all stores in this 100-store chain. As a by-product of this
#' research cooperation, approximately nine years of store-level data on the
#' sales of more than 3,500 UPCs is available in this dataset. This data is
#' unique for the breadth of its coverage and for the information available on
#' retail margins.
